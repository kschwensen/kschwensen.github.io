# Objective

The goal of this project was to explore the potential for generative design technology to be used to make a full-sized podium to be printed on a large format 3D printer. Here generative design is a practical choice as it uses multiple iterations in order to minimize the mass required to meet a certain safety standard and provide structural stability. Since the large format printer inherently takes a long time and produces heavy objects, any optimizations that can be made are especially helpful!

# Workflow and Design Considerations 

In order to make the model for the podium in Fusion 360, I first modeled the preserved geometry including the base, face plate, self, and lectern face. The model and dimensioned drawing is shown below. Notable design decisions were the size of the face plate which is parameterized and can be easily changed to reduce the overall weight of the part. Additionally, a flat shelf and lectern face at 15 degrees provide practical features for the final design. Once the preserved geometry has been created, the obstacles - or places where the generative design should not intrude upon - should be created. In this case, an obstacle was extruded where the space for the self should be and upon the lectern’s face. After these initial designs were developed the generative design interface was initiated and each body was assigned. Next, the forces were assigned. A force load was then applied to the edge of the lectern face of (2000 N, 800 N, 0 N). This was based on a net maximum load of a 300-pound speaker leaning with their entire body weight on the closest edge of the podium - an unlikely scenario. The base of the podium was defined as the fixed constraint as it will not move during this process. Additionally, a plane of symmetry was placed down the middle of the podium for both aesthetic reasons and for the valid assumption that there will be no preferential loading of one side of the podium versus the other. The material was selected to be ABS - similar to PLA, which does not exist in the Fusion 360 library. The manufacturing method was also defined as an additive process in the Y-direction with a maximum overhang angle of 45 degrees and a minimum thickness of 30 mm. These settings are the first step in ensuring the model is printable without supports on the large-scale FFF 3D printer. After the generative workspace has been defined, the interactive generation could begin. This process creates a study for each manufacturing method/material that you defined. The simulation iterates until they converge or complete a certain number of trials. Each study result can then be evaluated and modified by exporting the result to a design. The form feature of this design can be modified with several tools including simply moving the vertices and faces and smoothing out uneven regions. In this case, I used the modify tool in order to reduce some overhanging features. After modifications are complete, the file can be exported and printed as per usual. If desired one can confirm that the initial specifications are still met after the modifications in the form tool workspace with a force and stress simulation in Fusion 360. 

# Conclusions

Overall this project was able to highlight the potential of generative design in order to create load-bearing models with minimized material that can be translated with 3D printing. Further, while the podium was not printed on the large format 3D printer, it was designed such that it could have been successfully printed on at a large scale. However, the 1:20 model was printed easily without supports, indicating likely success in the large format context.

# Research and Discussion

Outside of creating podiums for our additive manufacturing class, this technology has far reaching potential including the generation of housing and architectural features with large scale 3D printers. With the ability to generate numerous models based on high level constraints, generative design is perfectly poised to limit the material requirements of traditional architecture, while maintaining, or even surpassing it in terms of strength. 

First it is valuable to understand where the need for optimization in this large format 3D printing space stems from. Current manufacturing and design methods rely heavily on the use of standard sized elements (often rectangular forms with uniform cross-sections) which require excess material to achieve the required mechanical properties. Considering that CO2 emissions from these techniques contribute up to 39% of total emissions - 5% comes from cement production alone-, any optimization in this space has the potential to make a large impact in the sustainability of future construction developments (1). Outside of carbon emissions, waste from inefficient construction processes is detrimental both for the environments and economics of the process. Further, in a developing world, the demand for construction materials regularly outpaces the supply (2).

As a result, researchers have been focused on developing new methods in order to make these processes more efficient. A promising approach has been to leverage generative design (GD) in order to quickly identify optimized designs which can minimize material while still ensuring that safety requirements are still maintained (3). GD uses computational power in order to simulate different potential designs, slowly converging on an optimal design which can meet specified design goals. Furthermore, the potential of this solution scales with the power of machine learning models and artificial intelligence, making this approach more appealing as these related technologies hit their stride. However, GD often produces forms that are abstract and impractical to build with traditional building materials. Thus, the coupling of GD with 3D printing allows for manufacturing synergy. 3D printing uses layer-wise deposition of material to allow for complex internal geometries and non-regular shapes. Applications of these coupled technologies are numerous, but are especially impactful in the area of architecture with large format concrete printers (4). 

Concrete printers are a practical application of large format 3D printers which can be used to print complex geometries out of a traditional construction material. Further, the nature of concrete 3D printing deposition limits some of the drawbacks of FFF 3D printing. Specifically, interlayer and intralayer adhesion is often better as the piece cures largely as a whole. However, the mix of concrete must be correct in order to ideal properties of pumpability, extrudability, and buildability. These properties respectively refer to the ability for the cement to be moved to the extruder apparatus, extruded out of the nozzle, and maintain its form after extrusion (5). This is often achieved with exact ratios between oxides, calcium, silicon and aluminum. The final mixture is ductile enough to be workable in the extruder, but quickly gels once extruded as a result of the cross-linking chemical reaction. While there are challenges, many of these have been addressed in innovative ways. For example, Yassin et al. used generative design to model steel reinforced cement rebars (4). In this case, the steel components were designed such that they could be printed with wire arc technology and the cement could be deposited around it with large format cement printing. Additionally, Marchment et al. developed a method of 3D printing cement by embedding a steel mesh within the structure (6). Uniquely, 3D printing allows for incorporation of reinforcements such as carbon fiber, recycled plastic, and composite metal, much like other FFF 3D printers. The versatile potential of cement 3D printing makes it an appealing option for future construction projects (7), 
 
There exist many case studies of successful cement 3D printing. Specifically, several houses - or parts of houses - have been 3D printed in significantly less time than traditional construction methods. Furthermore, these houses are more efficient and waste fewer materials than other methods. Several different types of housing have been created, varying from multi family homes in Houston and emergency shelters (8,9). While the multi-family home used more traditional rectangle geometry, the emergency shelters included some components which had used generative design in order to optimize parts (9). 

Given this background information, the synergy between large format cement printing and generative design can be characterized. The resolution of concrete 3D printing can reach a resolution of 1/16 inch, which is unattainable with traditional casting methods. Thus, small organic parts that are created with generative design can be more accurately rendered when coupled with 3D printing. More generally, cement casting is limited to more simplistic geometries such as those with no internal cavities. In architecture, the development of custom pieces which exist for a specific purpose, has been significantly more feasible with rapid GD model development. GD concrete printing has allowed for a material (and cost) reduction of 35 to 60 percent. A key qualifier of this technology is its ability to meet the mechanical properties which have been modeled in the generative design simulation. Multiple studies have shown that these GD and cement printed parts are able to meet the specifications (9). Additionally, the desire for rapid development of structures is particularly acute in the space of construction, where time is a vital resource. Both GD and 3D printing are technologies that are faster than their traditional counterparts. Relatedly, many of these structures require custom parts which are significantly easier to construct using these novel approaches. For example, in the previously mentioned emergency shelters, the frame of the shelter was iterated over with GD in order to produce a custom profile which was specific to the shelter’s purpose. This final modular profile (Figure 1) was able to be printed with a cement 3D printer. The timescale it takes to create the shelter is days compared to weeks achieved with other approaches. This style of customization would have been impractical with traditional manufacturing techniques. 

The future of this field will involve additional methods and technologies which are able to better integrate reinforced concrete into the generative design and large format 3D printing workflow. For example, Yassin et al. - previously mentioned - proposed a method of 3D printing internal steel reinforcements in order to match the abstract generative design of the concrete structure. Methods such as these which seek to improve the functionality of 3D printed concrete structures will make this solution more affordable and practical for a wider array of applications. Generative design -which allows for multiple materials -  would be specifically well suited to model these kinds of applications. Long term, I expect that more aspects of construction will utilize an integrated GD, 3D printing workflow!
