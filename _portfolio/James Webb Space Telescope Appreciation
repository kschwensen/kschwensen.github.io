Who isn't currently enamored with the James Webb Space Telescope's journey to bring astronomers amazing images of deep space? What better way to properly show appreciation besides making your own JWST model? This 3 ft by 3 ft piece of wall art was created by selectively removing wood with the CNC according to [this pattern](/assets/img/jwst.nc). The piece was then spray-painted matte black. The golden hexagons were cut out with a laser cutter. The hexagons were then fit into the recesses created by the CNC.
