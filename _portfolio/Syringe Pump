## Features
* **hello**
* **Accurate Flow Rates** The flow rate is controlled by the rotation of a lead screw initiated by a stepper motor. Our system can accurately achieve flow rates between 0.5 and 10 mL per minute.
* **Minimalistic Design** A key feature of this system is the minimalism associated with the 3D printed parts. Our team wanted this pump to be portable and low-profile for seamless integration into medical applications, as such thin holders move the syringe pump along the lead screw. 
* **Open Source Design**  A key feature of our design was its ability to affordably be replicated, costing less than $50 paired with detailed open source documentation our syringe pump is accessible for real-world application.
