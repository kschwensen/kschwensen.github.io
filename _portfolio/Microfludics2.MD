The goal of this project was to showcase how SLA 3D printing can be used to create molds for microfluidic device casting. 


Microfluidic devices are an invaluable tool when conducting precise experiments on small volumes of fluids and are routinely used in the biomedical and research industry. Many diagnostic, biological assays, and environmental assays rely on size based separation of certain distinctive molecules. Microflow devices provide an elegant solution to this problem, providing continuous, small scale, and affordable separation. 

The device which we created is designed to separate particles (on the order of 10-50 microns) differentially by size using a pinched flow fractionation system (Figure 1). This technology relies on the larger particles interacting with the solvent flow more than the smaller particles based solely on their size (Figure 2). Further, the separation efficiency can be modulated by altering the flow rates of the two input streams. A higher solute containing flow rates will result in a poorer separation as more fluid will shield the larger particles from the other solvent stream. Thus, this system is tunable. 

When designing our microfluidic mold, there were several parameters that we took into consideration. First was the size of the channels. With the Form 3 SLA printer we have a feature size resolution of 25 microns. While Yamada et al. created channels of 50 microns, we were concerned that this size of channel would not be preserved in our final PDMS device. Thus, the pinched section of our flow fractionation device was dimensioned at 100 microns. The angle at which the streams meet is 22.4 degrees, which is low enough to maintain laminar flow when the streams meet. Further, the pinched section opens up to one millimeter, which allows enough space for the particles to separate. See the dimensioned drawing for all measurements (Figure 
3).
