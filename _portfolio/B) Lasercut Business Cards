Attempting to make networking slightly less painful, I used the laser cutter to make myself a set of aluminum business cards. The laser vaporizes the thin anodized coating of the card revealing the shiny metal underneath. I had a ton of fun handing these out at BMES recruiting booths. 

The actual creation of these cards was relatively simple. I purchased matte black anodized aluminum cards. The line art design was created with the software Lightburn, and the cards were cut on a Boss 100 Watt laser cutter. Generally speaking, using a laser cutter with a minimum 30-watt CO laser will produce the best results. Use the manufacturer-recommended laser cutter setting for anodized aluminum.
