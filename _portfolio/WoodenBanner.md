The SyBBURE Searle Undergraduate Research Program sought a piece of wall art to announce the opening of their new maker space. I used the CNC to create abstract recesses that were then filled with components suspended in golden resin. These spaces are backlit with LEDs which change color in response to movement. 

Please check back for Arduino code, schematics, and detailed instructions!
