One of the highlights of my time at Vanderbilt University has been volunteering in the community to improve access to and excitement for science.

Vanderbilt Volunteers for Science (VSVS) is a program where undergraduates give guest demonstration at local middle and high schools. 


I have also been a dedicated mentor for project in a maker space at Vanderbilt. I teach my peers the basics of prototyping and how to safely operate equipment.
