Originally hailing from Lincoln, Nebraska, Katrina has long been interested in engineering solutions to treat complex problems in medicine. Through four years of undergraduate research, she has further cultivated this passion. Her primary project has been centered around drug delivery to the brain - see Research Interest for more info. In her free time, Katrina is an avid rock climber, and any weekend she isn't entertaining school and research obligations, you'll find her on the cliffsides of eastern Tennessee! She also loves cooking Mediterranean food with her friends.
