This project is motivated by recent findings that cerebrovascular dysfunction occurs at the initial stages of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Reducing pathological gene expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the brain barriers can mitigate disease with few off-target effects; however, no drugs can currently achieve this goal. Excitingly, we identified a lipid-siRNA conjugate (EG18-siRNA) that leverages albumin-binding to extend circulation half-life and accumulate in the cerebrovasculature after intravenous administration. In the Lippmann and Duvall Laboratories we leverage synthetic nucleic acid synthesis, _in vitro_ neurovascular models, and mouse models to evaluate the effect
